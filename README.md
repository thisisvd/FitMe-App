A Running Tracker App which tracks run or walk distance by using maps SDK and performs some tasks, show track routes on the maps, schedule things, shows articles by Android Jetpack Architecture. Tracks health of user by runs and calories burns and show user's statistics. 

## Objective

Number of smartphone users has spread rapidly around the globe, along with this the use of Health and fitness apps has also increased because people prefer to track their fitness from their mobile rather than the traditional method of going and seeing a doctor. 
There are several health and fitness apps in the market that are loaded with tons of features ,but these irrelevant features distracts the user and also makes the app complex to use ,taking away the main purpose of the app.
So keeping in mind all these factors we have developed a fitness app FITME which is user friendly and easy to use and has hassle free experience which does not distracts the users from their main goal.
